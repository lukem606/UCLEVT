You will start by testing your English vowel identification, then play memory-card games (i.e., click to find pairs of cards with the same word). You can play games any time you want and quit at any time. After you’ve played 50 times, you’ll be tested again. There is also an optional questionnaire for you to tell us about your language background." />

We will give you a random version of the memory card game so that we can test how different aspects of the game affect learning. We will save your responses as you play the game, but this data collection will be anonymous. The data will help us understand how people learn new languages and may help us design better training programs." />
